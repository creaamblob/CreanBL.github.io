                    <p>First progress report for my Terraria content mod, the <a href="https://creaamblob.github.io/CreanBL.github.io/Code/CreationsFolder/TranscendentMod.html">Transcendence Mod</a>.</p>
                    <p>
                        Most of the items are finished, but most of the boss drop weapons aren't created yet.<br><br>
                        Celestial Seraph is like 80% finished, but I really need to fight back the urge to rework the entire first phase and most of Phase 2/3 attacks.<br>
                        I need to make a Phase 3 sky and death animation.<br>
                        I've decided to delay the desperation phase.<br><br>
                        Atmospheron is in a playable state, but the phase 2 attacks are missing and the fight needs lots of polish.<br><br>
                        The rest of the bosses aren't in a playable state, but I have some great ideas that I will implement at some point.<br>
                        Procrastination and burnout greatly hinder my modding.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even though I haven't worked on the project at all, most of the big changes have happened recently.
                        Mainly coming up with the name of the mod and overhauling The Cosmos biome <thought>(Now called Transcendent Abyss/Ascendant Realm)</thought>.<br><br>
                        Transcendent Abyss is the daytime counterpart to the Ascendant Realm. The abyss is really dark, eerie and hostile.
                        You have to constantly fight agaisnt the heavy fog that keeps pushing you down.<br><br>
                        Ascendant Realm is the nighttime counterpart, which is floaty and holy.<br>
                        The Ascendant Realm isn't really finished currently, but I have some ideas that I will elaborate on later.<br><br>
                        The mod's main scope is fixing the problems I have with the game and just adding stuff that I want.
                        Mainly combat and gathering based content.<br>
                        Some of the things introduced by my mod, I just can't live without. Like parrying and the various tools.<br>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Playing other mods have helped me with coming up with ideas.<br>
                        I can find mistakes that others have made and I can avoid repeating them.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Modding has sometimes been extremely draining to me, especially since I'm a solo dev.<br>
                        Sometimes I fear that the mod might never get published, but it's too late to turn back.<br><br>
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        This progress report was pretty chaotic, and turned into a venting session halfway through.<br>
                        I'll do better next time.
